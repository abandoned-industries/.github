# Abandoned Industries

**Reviving abandoned software for academics, intellectuals, and anybody else.**

---

I use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) to resurrect useful applications that have been left behind by the relentless march of progress—particularly tools that once served researchers, writers, and intellectuals.


I'm not trying to make money. I'm not trying to take over anyone's project. If you're the original developer of something Iforked and you'd prefer I didn't, just let us know—I'll take it down. 

**Current focus:** Mac applications orphaned by the transition to Apple Silicon.
